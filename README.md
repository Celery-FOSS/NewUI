* Run `Celery.exe`

<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>

* Open Roblox from the Microsoft Store and join a game. 
    * Make sure you aren't using the web version as it's not currently supported by Celery.
* Click the attach button, its an icon that looks like a syringe.
* It should say "Celery Loaded" in the top left of Roblox
    * If it doesn't, there might be an issue with your antivirus. Click here to see how fix it.
* Search for a script that is fitted for the game you are currently in.
    * Please use reputable scripts, it's possible to get hacked yourself if you aren't careful with what you do.
* Paste the script inside the text box within Celery and click the execute button which is the one with the play icon.
